                <b>Artist Biography</b> <br>Zain ul Mursaleen is a Production Designer and a Visual Artist living and practicing In
                Karachi. Grew up watching and learning design from his Father a graduate of JJ School
                who formed one of the pioneer Advertising studios in Karachi.
                Studied painting from CIAC in 2002 located at the Arts council of Pakistan. During his
                studies, he worked designing furniture which later on became his obsession with
                developing environments and sets for TV. For a decade worked with Geo tv networks.
                From designing new-age cafes to restaurants his understanding of spaces and design

              <b>Artist Statement: Project Zink</b> <br>
              Project Zink is a body of work created between 2019 and 2024, born from a deep
              appreciation for traditional South Asian art and design. This project investigates the
              intersection of my regional heritage with contemporary tattoo culture, fostering a
              dialogue about how the consumption of imagery influences our identities over time.
              I work with watercolors in Mughal miniature technique, as well as digitally. i really feel
              mediums do not matter if there is a reach for broader audience. I draw parallels between
              the images and symbols prevalent in contemporary tattoo design. The motifs and
              patterns derived from my cultural heritage are intertwined with tattoo imagery,
              reflecting the complexities of belonging and self-expression.
              In Pakistan, tattoos are often viewed as unacceptable and contradictory to the prevailing
              cultural norms. This societal perception introduces a layer of tension into my work,
              underscoring the conflict between traditional values and modern expressions of identity.
              While my designs may initially evoke Eastern and Turkish art, they are ultimately
              inspired by the diverse visual language we encounter in today's digital landscape.
              Through this synthesis of styles, Project Zink explores the intricate relationship between
              cultural heritage and contemporary influences
